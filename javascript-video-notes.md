# Video notes from a JavaScript video from Microsoft Learn

## Video 1:

- Intro video, quick basics of how the video series works, who the people behind it are and what basic knowledge is expected from the people going through the series.

---

## Video 2:

- Basics of JS, what it's used for, why would anyone want to learn and use JS.
- Where it's mostly used for, such as web sites, desktop apps and server frameworks.
- JS is very flexible and usable code-language capable of doing basically everything i suppose.

---

## Video 3:

- Server JS vs Client JS.
- Client JS is usually web browser, usually by having JS-files referenced with script-tag in HTML-file of the website.
- Server JS usually a service that handles files, databases etc. node.js used to allow execution of JS code.

## Video 4:

- TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLS
- What all you need to write and create JS-based applications. Such as IDE, Node, extensions etc.
- Includes some handy extensions (which i already have)

## Video 5:

- Installing VSCode and Node.
- I had Node and VSCode installed, so I just opened VSCode and checked versions and updated them.

---

## Video 6:

- First JS application creation with Node.JS
- Simple console.log() thingy to show how logs can be done cleanly in terminal.

## Video 7:

- Commenting on my code.
- How, when and why comments matter. Such as leaving reminders, taking code blocks out with just commenting them out or leaving tips on how a function works.
- Do's and Do nots.
- Code is self documenting with clear variable names, function names etc, study programs may have everything commented out to explain each line in order to hammer in what code does.

---
## Video 8:

- Showing comments. Waow.

---
## Video 9:

- Declaring variables, how JS works with vars.
- No need for Int, String, Bool etc. JS runtime looks at the variable itself and goes "aha, that is a number".
